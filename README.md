# claude-usage

A live **Claude.ai usage dashboard** for the terminal — every rate limit,
credit balance, and account detail, rendered as a responsive panel that reflows
from a full control panel down to a single 40×1 status strip.

It reads the same private endpoints the claude.ai web app uses, authenticating
with your existing browser session cookie — no API key, nothing to configure.

## Features

- **Responsive layout.** One renderer picks the right form for the window:
  a full control panel (≥46×20), a compact vertical stack, a horizontal gauge
  strip for short windows, or a vertical bar chart for narrow/tall ones — down
  to a 40×5 (even 40×1) cell.
- **Everything the API exposes.** Session/weekly limits, model-scoped limits,
  credits and spend, extra usage, plus account, connectors/MCP, cowork status,
  live code sessions, and recent chats (large windows only).
- **Context window per session.** How full each of your local Claude Code
  sessions is, read straight from its transcript — no network involved.
- **Pace at a glance.** Every limit bar carries a tick showing how much of the
  reset window has elapsed, so "am I burning too fast?" is a length comparison,
  not arithmetic. Needs no history — it's there on the first frame.
- **Warm "heat" gauge.** Bars shift from soft tan through Claude orange to rust
  red as a limit fills, so severity reads at a glance — or pick another of the
  four themes (`cool`, `mono`, `contrast`) with `--theme`.
- **Your panel, your order.** Choose which big-panel sections appear and in
  what order (`--sections`, or `sections = [...]` in the config), and toggle
  them live from the keyboard.
- **Threshold alerts.** Configurable per-limit warning levels, delivered by
  `notify-send` (or stdout), fired once per crossing — from the live dashboard
  or a cron `--once` run.
- **Resilient.** Every secondary endpoint is best-effort — one dead endpoint
  never blanks the panel. Cloudflare challenges and expired sessions are
  reported distinctly.

## Install

Requires Python 3.9+.

Install as a command with [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io):

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/parsaj-dev/claude-usage-dashboard
# or from a local checkout:
pipx install .
```

This puts a `claude-usage` command on your PATH. To also read cookies from the
browser automatically, install the optional extra:

```bash
pipx install "claude-usage[cookies] @ git+https://github.com/parsaj-dev/claude-usage-dashboard"
```

`browser-cookie3` (the `cookies` extra) is optional; without it, supply the
cookie manually (below).

## Usage

```bash
claude-usage              # live dashboard, refresh every 2 min
claude-usage -n 30        # refresh core usage every 30s
```

Keys, while running:

| Key            | Action                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `r` / `space`  | refresh now                                             |
| `t`            | cycle to the next color theme                           |
| `s`            | toggle "just the numbers" (hide all but limits/credits) |
| `1`…`9`        | show/hide the Nth panel section                         |
| `q` / `Ctrl-C` | quit                                                    |

`t`, `s` and the digit keys affect the big panel only, and are not persisted —
put a lasting choice in the config file (`theme`, `sections`).

### Options

| `--trends`             | off     | Also draw the history trend sparklines.             |
| `--context-window`     | `200000`| Assumed context window for the CONTEXT section.     |
| `--context-sessions`   | `3`     | Local sessions in the CONTEXT section (0 = off).    |

## History & headless mode

Each core refresh records a small snapshot — the limit percentages and their
reset times, plus spend — as one line of JSON in an append-only history file at
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/claude-usage/history.jsonl`
(`~/.local/share/claude-usage/history.jsonl`). Only the numbers already on
screen are stored; never raw API payloads. In the **live dashboard**, a refresh
whose numbers match the last stored reading is skipped, so an idle dashboard
doesn't bloat the file.

`--once` is a headless, cron-friendly mode: it fetches a single snapshot,
appends it, and exits silently (add `--print` to echo the JSON). Each `--once`
run writes exactly one record — it does **not** dedup — so you control the
sample cadence via cron. A crontab line that records your usage every 15
minutes:

```cron
*/15 * * * * claude-usage --once
```

Use `history_max` to cap how many records are kept if you sample often.
Persistence is on by default; disable it with `--no-persist` (or `persist =
false` in config). This history file is the foundation for the trends and
alerting features that follow.

### Pace tick

Every limit bar carries a one-cell tick (`┃`) showing **how much of the reset
window has elapsed**. Usage and elapsed time are both percentages on the same
0–100 scale, so they share one bar:

```
5-hour    ████████████████┃██████▍░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  42.5%
          ↺ 3h 29m · 6:00pm  ┃ 1.4× pace
```

Tick **left** of the fill edge → you're burning faster than the window
replenishes. Tick **right** of it → you have slack. Dead level → `on pace`.

It needs no history file and no stored samples: the window length is implied by
the limit kind and the remaining time comes from `resets_at`, both of which are
in every reading. So it's there on the first frame, in every layout. Limits
with no reset time (or an unrecognized window) simply get no tick. The `N× pace`
gloss is dropped on narrow panels, and suppressed right after a reset where the
ratio would be noise.

### Trend sparklines (opt-in)

**Off by default** — the pace tick above answers the same question more
directly, and without waiting for samples to accumulate. Turn them on with
`--trends`, `CLAUDE_USAGE_TRENDS=1`, or `trends = true` in the config.

In the full panel layout (large windows), each limit then gets a small
block-glyph `trend` sparkline under its bar — the last several readings of that limit's
usage percentage, on a fixed 0–100 scale:

```
5-hour    ██████████████▊░░░░░░░░░░░░   60%
          ⭮ 3h
          trend ▂▂▃▅▄▅
```

Trends are seeded from the history file at startup (so prior runs and cron
`--once` samples show up right away) and fill in further as the dashboard runs.
They appear only in the full panel; smaller layouts show bars alone. The trend
buffer works even with `--no-persist` (it just isn't written to disk).

Note the honest limitation that motivated the pace tick: samples are only
recorded when the numbers *change*, so the horizontal axis isn't proportional to
time — one glyph might be two minutes and the next six hours.

## Themes

`--theme NAME` (or `theme = "…"` in the config) picks the palette. Themes change
**color only** — never layout, glyphs, or widths — so every window size renders
the same shape whichever you pick.

| Theme      | Look                                                              |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claude`   | **Default.** Warm: soft tan → Claude orange → rust red.           |
| `cool`     | Pale cyan → blue → violet → hot magenta. Same reading, cool side. |
| `mono`     | Greyscale; severity reads as brightness. Good for screenshots.    |
| `contrast` | High-contrast green → yellow → orange → red on pure white text.   |

```bash
claude-usage --theme contrast
```

The default is unchanged from before themes existed — byte for byte, and there's
a test pinning it to a golden hash so it stays that way. An unrecognized theme
name falls back to the default rather than refusing to start.

## Context window per session

The `CONTEXT` section shows how full each of your recent **local Claude Code
sessions** is:

```
CONTEXT
usage-tracker  ████████████████████████████████████████░░░░░░░ 170k/200k
  85% · main · just now
Yekta 6dd7     ████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 83k/200k
  42% · main · 2m ago
```

This reads Claude Code's own transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/` (honoring
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) — **no network, no cookie**. The number is the last
`message.usage` record in each transcript:

```
input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens
```

Cached tokens still occupy the window, so they count; `output_tokens` is the
reply rather than the prompt, so it doesn't. Transcripts run to megabytes, so
only the last 256 KB of each is parsed, and only the newest few files are opened
at all — a scan takes a handful of milliseconds. It refreshes on the extras
clock (`--extras-interval`), never on the redraw tick.

Sessions are labeled by project directory, disambiguated with a short session id
when one project has several. Set `--context-sessions 0` (or hide the `context`
section) to turn it off.

> The window size is assumed, not discovered — the transcript records tokens
> used, not the model's limit. Set `--context-window` if you're on a model with
> a different one. `context_max_age` (config-only, default 86400s) ignores
> transcripts that haven't been touched recently.

## Panel sections

The big panel (≥46×20) is composed from named sections. By default all of them
render, in this order:

| Name           | What it shows                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `limits`       | Session/weekly limit bars, resets, trend sparklines     |
| `additional`   | Model-scoped / cowork / host buckets, when present      |
| `credits`      | Spend, balance, cap, credit toggles                     |
| `extra_usage`  | Extra-usage status and utilization, when present        |
| `context`      | Context-window usage of local Claude Code sessions       |
| `sessions`     | Live code sessions                                      |
| `recent`       | Recent chats                                            |
| `account`      | Name, org, rate tier, billing                           |
| `connectors`   | Web search / Drive / MCP-style toggles                  |
| `cowork`       | Cowork setup status                                     |

Pick a subset — and an order — with the flag, the environment variable, or the
config file:

```bash
claude-usage --sections limits,credits,sessions
CLAUDE_USAGE_SECTIONS="limits,credits" claude-usage
```

A section with nothing to show is skipped silently, so a slimmer panel is safe
to configure. Unknown names are ignored, and a list that ends up empty falls
back to the full default order rather than rendering a blank panel. Smaller
layouts don't use sections at all — they always show the limit bars.

## Threshold alerts

The point of watching a limit is to act *before* it runs out, so a limit that
reaches its threshold raises an alert: a desktop notification via `notify-send`
if libnotify is installed, otherwise a line on stdout.

Defaults are 80% for the 5-hour limit, 90% for the 7-day one, and 80% for
anything else. Set your own per limit under `[alert]` in the config file, or
override every limit at once with `--alert-threshold`:

```toml
[alert]
"5-hour" = 70     # "5h" and "7d" work as aliases
"7-day"  = 85
"Opus 7d" = 90
default  = 80     # anything without an entry of its own
```

An alert fires **once per crossing**. It won't repeat while the limit stays
elevated; it re-arms when the limit drops back under its threshold (a reset),
or when you change the threshold. Set `alert_cooldown` to be re-nagged every N
seconds while a limit is still over.

That state lives in `alerts.json` next to the history file, which is what lets
a stateless cron `--once` run stay quiet after the first warning. `--once`
exits **2** when an alert fired (**1** is a fetch/persist failure, **0** is
fine), so a wrapper can act on the warning alone:

```cron
*/15 * * * * claude-usage --once || [ $? -ne 2 ] || echo "claude usage high" | mail -s alert me
```

In the live dashboard, alerts go to `notify-send` only — printing into the
fixed-height redraw would corrupt the frame, and the panel is already showing
the percentage that triggered it. Notification failures are always swallowed:
a missing or wedged notification daemon can never stall or crash a poll.

Turn the whole thing off with `--no-alerts` (or `alerts = false`).

## Configuration

Every setting except `--cookie` (a secret, never read from disk) can be set in a
config file so you don't retype it. Values are resolved with this precedence:

**CLI flag → environment variable → config file → built-in default.**

The config file lives at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/claude-usage/config.toml` (i.e.
`~/.config/claude-usage/config.toml`). Keys mirror the flag names with
underscores:

```toml
# ~/.config/claude-usage/config.toml
interval = 60
extras_interval = 300
bootstrap_interval = 0
cookie_source = "firefox"
org = "your-org-uuid"
theme = "claude"         # claude | cool | mono | contrast

trends = false           # opt in to the history trend sparklines

# Context window usage of local Claude Code sessions
context_window = 200000    # assumed model context window, in tokens
context_sessions = 3       # how many sessions to show (0 = off)
context_max_age = 86400    # ignore transcripts untouched for longer than this

# Big-panel sections: which blocks show, and in what order. Omit the key for
# all of them in the default order. Unknown names are ignored.
sections = ["limits", "additional", "credits", "extra_usage",
            "sessions", "recent", "account", "connectors", "cowork"]

# History / persistence
persist = true
history_path = "~/.local/share/claude-usage/history.jsonl"
history_max = 0          # cap on records kept (0 = unlimited)

# Alerting
alerts = true
alert_notifier = "auto"  # auto | notify-send | stdout | none
alert_cooldown = 0       # 0 = fire once per crossing; N = re-nag every N s

[alert]                  # per-limit thresholds, in percent
"5-hour" = 70
"7-day"  = 85
```

Matching environment variables: `CLAUDE_USAGE_INTERVAL`,
`CLAUDE_USAGE_EXTRAS_INTERVAL`, `CLAUDE_USAGE_BOOTSTRAP_INTERVAL`,
`CLAUDE_USAGE_COOKIE_SOURCE`, `CLAUDE_USAGE_PERSIST`,
`CLAUDE_USAGE_HISTORY_PATH`, `CLAUDE_USAGE_ALERTS`,
`CLAUDE_USAGE_ALERT_THRESHOLD`, `CLAUDE_USAGE_ALERT_NOTIFIER`,
`CLAUDE_USAGE_ALERT_STATE_PATH`, `CLAUDE_USAGE_THEME`, and `CLAUDE_ORG_ID`
(for `org`).

The `[alert]` threshold table is config-file-only — there's no sensible flat
spelling for a per-limit map on the command line or in the environment.
`--alert-threshold` / `CLAUDE_USAGE_ALERT_THRESHOLD` replaces the whole table
with one blanket number.

## Authentication

The tool needs your logged-in `claude.ai` session cookie.

1. **Automatic (default).** With `browser-cookie3` installed, the cookie is read
   from your browser — Chrome/Chromium first, then Firefox (`--cookie-source`
   pins one). If your keyring is locked, decryption can fail — unlock it or use
   the manual path.
2. **Manual.** Copy the `sessionKey` cookie from DevTools and pass it:
   ```bash
   claude-usage --cookie 'sessionKey=sk-ant-...'
   ```

> **Firefox note:** the outbound request uses a Chrome User-Agent (Cloudflare
> binds its `cf_clearance` cookie to the UA that earned it). A Firefox-sourced
> `sessionKey` generally works, but a Firefox `cf_clearance` may still trigger a
> Cloudflare challenge. If you hit one, load `claude.ai` in Chrome once, or use
> `--cookie` manually.

Your cookie is used only to call `claude.ai` directly. Nothing is stored or sent
anywhere else.

## Organization ID

The dashboard queries a per-organization usage endpoint, so it needs your org's
UUID. It is **discovered automatically** from `/api/bootstrap` — normally you
never touch this. To pin it explicitly (or if bootstrap is unreachable):

```bash
claude-usage --org <uuid>
# or
export CLAUDE_ORG_ID=<uuid>
```

Find the UUID in claude.ai DevTools → Network → any
`/api/organizations/<uuid>/...` request.

## How it works

`claude.ai` exposes rich JSON endpoints behind your session cookie. The core one
is `/api/organizations/<org>/usage` (limits + credits); the big panel also pulls
`/api/bootstrap` (account/org config), live code sessions, recent chats, and
cowork setup. Each is fetched best-effort, on its own clock.

**Extending it:** the script has a detailed in-file guide (see the banner
comment above `BOOTSTRAP_URL`) on discovering new endpoints from DevTools and
wiring them into a panel section. The rendering pipeline is a set of pure
functions — `render(data, cols, rows, interval, mdef)` dispatches to a
layout-specific renderer based on the terminal size — which makes the layout
easy to reason about and test.

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"         # install with dev deps (pytest)
pytest -q                        # run the test suite
python3 tests/test_usage.py     # or run the same tests without pytest
```

The tests render a fixed fixture across the full size matrix under a frozen
clock and assert the org-discovery precedence, so refactors can be verified not
to change any user-visible output.
